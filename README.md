# Little Giant AI - WORKING Extension 🏔️

## 🎉 FIXED AND WORKING VERSION

This is a **completely working** Chrome extension that connects to your local LM Studio.

### ✅ What's Fixed:
- **NO ES6 modules** in service worker (compatibility issue resolved)
- **NO async message handlers** (Chrome MV3 requirement)
- **Proper message handling** with sendResponse and return true
- **Direct class definitions** in service worker (no imports)
- **Simplified architecture** that actually works
- **Proper error handling** and logging

### 🚀 Installation:

1. **Make sure LM Studio is running:**
   - Start LM Studio
   - Load a model (e.g., DeepSeek Coder v2 Lite)
   - Start the server on `http://localhost:1234`

2. **Install the extension:**
   - Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the extracted `little-giant-WORKING` folder

3. **Test it:**
   - Click the Little Giant icon 🏔️
   - Click "🔌 Test Connection" → should show "✅ Connected"
   - Type a message and press Enter
   - You should get a response from your local AI!

### 🔧 Features:
- **Local AI Chat** - Direct connection to LM Studio
- **Connection Testing** - Verify LM Studio is reachable
- **Page Analysis** - Basic content script integration
- **Error Handling** - Clear error messages and logging

### 🐛 Debugging:
- Open `chrome://extensions/` → Click "service worker" link
- Check console logs for detailed debugging info
- All operations are logged with emojis for easy identification

### 💡 Key Architecture Changes:
- Service worker uses **class definitions directly** (no imports)
- Message handlers are **synchronous functions** that call async helpers
- **Proper Chrome MV3 compliance** throughout
- **Simplified** but fully functional

This extension now works reliably with LM Studio running on localhost:1234!
